Atomic CSS and utility-first frameworks are rapidly rising in popularity as a simple yet powerful approach to styling components.

Atomic CSS involves defining styles for short "atom" classes that target a single style declaration, such as .text-red-500 for red text or .truncate for truncating text. You compose elements by stacking these classes , allowing extremely modular and reusable styles.

Atomic CSS offers many benefits over traditional CSS:

• Scalability: Easily build complex designs through composition of atomic styles.
• Simple: Class names map directly to CSS declarations for an intuitive API.
• Flexibility: Only include the exact styles your project needs.

Many developers are now adopting atomic-first frameworks that implement this concept at scale like tailwindcss.
